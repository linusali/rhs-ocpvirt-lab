= Migrating Virtual Machines

== Introduction

This portion of our lab uses the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/migration_toolkit_for_virtualization/[Migration Toolkit for Virtualization^] (MTV) to import virtual machines from VMware vSphere to OpenShift. The migration toolkit supports two "modes" of import:

* Cold migration turns off the source virtual machine before starting the migration. This is the default migration type.
* Warm migration copies data while the source virtual machine continues to run. Once the bulk of data has been migrated, the VM is shutdown and the final data is copied to the destination. The new VM can then be started, resulting in a much shorter period of downtime for the VM-hosted application.

NOTE: The migration toolkit has already been deployed to your cluster using the Operator available in OperatorHub. 

Documentation for how to install and configure the Operator can be found https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/migration_toolkit_for_virtualization/2.6/html/installing_and_using_the_migration_toolkit_for_virtualization/installing-the-operator_mtv[here^].

[[prerequisites]]
== Prerequisites for Migrations

////
The firewalls must enable traffic over the following ports:

. Network ports required for migrating from VMware vSphere
+
[cols="1,1,1,1,1"]
|===
|*Port*|*Protocol*|*Source*|*Destination*|*Purpose*
|443|TCP|OpenShift nodes|VMware vCenter|VMware provider inventory
Disk transfer authentication
|443|TCP|OpenShift nodes|VMware ESXi hosts|Disk transfer authentication
|902|TCP|OpenShift nodes|VMware ESXi hosts|Disk transfer data copy
|===
////

The following prerequisites apply to all migrations:

* ISO/CD-ROM disks must be unmounted.
* Each NIC must contain one IPv4 and/or one IPv6 address.
* The VM operating system must be certified and supported for use as a guest operating system for https://access.redhat.com/articles/973163#ocpvirt[OpenShift Virtualization^].
* VM names must contain only lowercase letters (a-z), numbers (0-9), or hyphens (-), up to a maximum of 253 characters. The first and last characters must be alphanumeric. The name must not contain uppercase letters, spaces, periods (.), or special characters.
* VM names must not duplicate the name of an existing VM in the OpenShift Virtualization environment.

NOTE: The *Migration Toolkit for Virtualization* will automatically assign a new name to a VM that does not comply with the rules, doing so allows the migration to proceed smoothly.

== Migrating Virtual Machines from VMware

A three-tier application has been deployed on VMware for you to migrate to OpenShift.

The application is accessible from the following link: http://webapp.vc.opentlc.com/[WebApp^]. It will display a visitor counter, and the hostname of the webserver that returned your request.

The application consists of the following four virtual machines:

* One HAproxy system that redirects traffic to the web servers
* One Linux system running a MariaDB database
* Two Microsoft Windows servers with IIS hosting a PHP application connecting to the database

For this lab, you will be tasked with migrating three of the four virtual machines using cold migration.

NOTE: You will not need to migrate the HAproxy (load balancer) VM because OpenShift handles network traffic and load balancing natively for VMs connected to the SDN using a *Service*.

=== Review the VMware environment

To help understand the process of mapping resources, such as datastores and port groups, from vSphere into OpenShift's equivalents, storage classes and network attachment definitions, let's begin by reviewing the source environment for the migrations.

. Navigate to VMware vCenter: https://{vcenter_console}[vCenter Console^]

. Login with the following credentials:
- *User:* {vcenter_user}
- *Password:* {vcenter_password}

. By default you'll land in the *Inventory* view at the top of the navigation tree. Click the *Workloads* icon and expand the navigation tree until you see the folder that matches your username, and the 4 VMs under it. Click the *VMs* tab at the top of the screen to view the VM details.
+

+
. Change to the *Networks* view, then expand the tree to view the port group used by the virtual machines. Note that the name is *segment-migrating-to-ocpvirt*.
+
image::module-05/01_vSphere_Network.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. Finally, review the datastores in use by browsing to the *Datastores* view. Expand the tree to see the datastores that are attached to the *SDDC-Datacenter*, and optionally browse to the *VMs* sub-tab to view the capacity used by each virtual machine.
+
image::module-05/02_vSphere_Datastore.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

=== Review the VMware provider to the migration toolkit

The *Migration Toolkit for Virtualization* (*MTV*) uses the VMware Virtual Disk Development Kit (*VDDK*) SDK to transfer virtual disks from VMware vSphere. The VDDK has already been configured for you in this environment.

. Navigate in the left menu to *Migration* -> *Providers for virtualization*
. Select project *openshift-mtv*
+
image::module-05/03_MTV_Providers.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
+
[TIP]
MTV 2.4 and later are project/namespace aware and do not require administrator privileges. You can delegate VM imports to application teams and VM users so that they can self-serve and migrate at their own pace!

. By default, there is a provider called *host* which represents *OpenShift Virtualization* as a target platform.
+
image::module-05/04_MTV_Provider_List.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
+
. The lab is already configured with the VMWare provider named *vmware* and it is marked as a migration source.

////
However, you will need to register the source vCenter system to the Migration Toolkit for Virtualization as a new provider.

. By default, there is a provider called *host* which represents *OpenShift Virtualization* as a target platform
+
image::module-05/04_MTV_Provider_list.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. Press *Create Provider* button in the top right. A dialog it will appear.
+
image::module-05/05_MTV_Create_Provider.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
+
. Select *VMware* on the *Provider type* dropdown and fill the following data:
.. *Name*: *vmware*
.. *vCenter host name or IP address*: *portal.vc.opentlc.com*
.. *vCenter user name*: {vcenter_user}
.. *vCenter password*: {vcenter_password}
.. *VDDK init image*: *image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/openshift/vddk:latest*
.. *SHA-1 fingerprint*: *70:2D:52:D2:D1:A5:A2:75:58:8F:3D:07:D5:7E:E9:73:81:BC:88:A2*
+
image::module-05/06_MTV_Fill_Dialog.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
.  Press *Create* and wait till the *Status* column is changed to *Ready*
+
image::module-05/07_MTV_Provider_Added.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

Now MTV knows about your VMware vSphere environment and can connect to it.

2.6 MADE THIS YAML ONLY, SKIPPING IN LAB FOR NOW, CONTENT STILL HERE IF NEEDED LATER.

=== Create storage and network mappings

Storage and networking resources are managed differently in VMware vSphere and Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization. Therefore it is necessary to create mappings from the source datastores and networks in VMware vSphere to the equivalent resources in OpenShift so that the migration toolkit understands how to connect and place virtual machines after they are imported.

These only need to be configured once and are then reused in subsequent VM Migration Plans.

. Navigate in the left menu to *Migration* -> *NetworkMaps for virtualization* and click on the *Create NetworkMap* button.
+
image::module-05/08_MTV_NetworkMaps.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. Fill in the following information in the appeared dialog. Press *Create*.
.. *Name*: *mapping-segment*
.. *Source provider*: *vmware*
.. *Target provider*: *host*
.. Click *Add*
.. *Source networks*: *segment-migrating-to-ocpvirt*
.. *Target network*: *Pod network (default)*
+
image::module-05/09_Add_VMWARE_Mapping_Network.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. Ensure the created mapping has the *Status* *Ready*.
+
image::module-05/10_List_VMWARE_Mapping_Network.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. Navigate in the left menu to *Migration* -> *StorageMaps for virtualization* and click on the *Create StorageMap* button.
+
image::module-05/11_MTV_StorageMaps.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. Fill in the following information. Press *Create*.
.. *Name*: *mapping-datastore*
.. *Source provider*: *vmware*
.. *Target provider*: *host*
.. Click *Add*
.. *Source storage*: *WorkloadDatastore*
.. *Target storage classs*: *ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd-virtualization*
+
image::module-05/12_Add_VMWARE_Mapping_Storage.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. Ensure the created mapping has the *Status* *Ready*.
+
image::module-05/13_List_VMWARE_Mapping_Storage.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
////

=== Create a Migration Plan

Now that we have reviewed our environment, and have our providers created, it is time for us to create a Migration Plan. This plan selects which VMs to migrate from VMware vSphere to Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization and specifics about how to execute the migration.

. Navigate in the left menu to *Migration* -> *Plans for virtualization* and press *Create plan*.
+
image::module-05/14_Create_VMWARE_Plan.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
+
. You will be asked to select the source provider that you intend to migrate from. Click on the *VMware* tile.
+
image::module-05/16_VMware_Source_Provider.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
+
. On the next page select the three VMs you would like to move:

* database
* winweb01
* winweb02

. Click *Next*.
+
image::module-05/17_VM_Select_VMWARE_Plan.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
+
. On the next screen you will be tasked with providing details for your migration plan. Several details will already be filled in for you, but you will have to make a few minor modifications to ensure that the VMs land in the correct namespace, and that the networks and storage options map correctly. 
+
Please fill in your migration plan with the following values:

* Plan name: *move-webapp-vmware*
* Target namespace: *vmexamples*
* Network map: *Pod Networking*
* Storage map: *ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd-virtualization*
+
NOTE: Both the Network and Storage map will automatically detect the Network and Datastore that the discovered virtual machines currently make use of on the source provider. You will just need to make sure that their respective values are set correctly on the OpenShift side. 
+
. Click *Create migration plan*.
+
image::module-05/18_Create_Migration_Plan.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
+
. You will be taken to a new screen where you will see that the plan for migration is being made ready.
+
image::module-05/19_Migration_Plan_Unready.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
+
. After a few moments the plan will become *Ready*, click on the green "Play" button in the center of the window to start the migration process.
+
image::module-05/20_Migration_Plan_Ready.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
+
. You will be presented with a confirmation box to begin the migration, click on the *Start* button.
+
image::module-05/21_Confirm_Migrate_Start.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
+
. A progress bar will appear in the center of the screen along with the status of *0 of 3 VMs migrated*.
+
image::module-05/22_VMs_Migrating.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
+
. Click on the *0 of 3 VMs migrated* link and you will be presented with a page with more details about the migration process.
+
image::module-05/23_VMs_Migrating_Details.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
+
. You can click the drop-down arrow next to the name of each VM being migrated to get additional details about the stages of the migration process.
+
image::module-05/24_VM_Migration_Stages.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
+
IMPORTANT: Having many participants performing the same task in parallel can cause this task to perform slower than in a real environment. For the Red Hat Summit Lab instance we have limited the number of in-flight VMs to 1 at a time. Please be patient with this process.
+
. After several minutes the migration has completed.
+
image::module-05/25_Completed_VMWARE_Plan.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
+
. The selected VMs have now been migrated and can be started on OpenShift Virtualization. 

== Summary

In this section we explored the Migration Toolkit for Virtualization, and used it to assist with the migration of existing virtual machines from a VMware vSphere environment to OpenShift Virtualization. In addition to the Migration Toolkit for Virtualization, there are three other migration toolkits. The combination of these can be used to move many types of workloads into and within OpenShift clusters depending on your organization's needs. 

* https://developers.redhat.com/products/mtr/overview[Migration Toolkit for Runtimes^] - Assist and accelerate Java application modernization and migration.
* https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/migration_toolkit_for_applications/[Migration Toolkit for Applications^] - Accelerate large-scale application modernization efforts to containers and Kubernetes.
* https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.15/migration_toolkit_for_containers/about-mtc.html[Migration Toolkit for Containers^] - Migrate stateful application workloads between OpenShift clusters.

For more information about these other migration toolkits, please reach out to your Red Hat account team.
